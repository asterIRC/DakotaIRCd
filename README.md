DakotaIRCd
==========

This is the new, plexus4/hybrid8 based DakotaIRCd 1.0.

Why DakotaIRCd?
===============

This IRCd started out as a spork of SporksIRCd. It is now a full blown project to port certain things from Charybdis to the PleXus 4 IRCd (which will soon be Rizon's IRCd) and to make the overall chatting experience better.

Supported third party software
==============================

* Sorry, Denora isn't yet compatible. We use a special UID system called XUID which is not TS6 compatible.
* Atheme is compatible (see contrib/atheme_modules_protocol_dakotaircd.c)
